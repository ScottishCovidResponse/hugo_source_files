## Software Checklist
Each model had a lead Research Software Engineer during the RAMP period and they produced a common checklist to assess and record their level of confidence in the software implementations. The completed checklists are linked in the table and the [template has been released](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/modelling-resources/blob/main/software-checklist.md) under a creative commons licence.
