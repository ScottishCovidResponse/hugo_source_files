# Data Sources and Products

The following information was compiled in July 2020

## Administrative Spatial Scales in UK

The UK is split into different levels of administrative areas and differing amounts of data are available at these different spatial scales. Different government agencies are responsible for the different countries and data may need to be sourced from these different sources.

**Top level** – UK is split into four Countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

### England & Wales [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/)

| Spatial Scale | Average Population Size |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Regions | 6.2 Million |
| Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLA) | 1.8 Million |
| Lower Tier Local Authorities (LTLA) | 300,000 |
| Middle Super Output Areas (MSOA) | 7500 |
| Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA) | 1500 |

### Scotland [NRS](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/ )

| Spatial Scale | Average Population Size |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Health Boards | 390,236 |
| Local Authorities | 170,728 |
| Datazones | 800 |
| Output Areas | 150 |

The [Open Geography portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/) from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) provides free and open access to the definitive source of geographic products.

## Sources of review articles and literature for epidemic parameters

1. The following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01283) contains information collated from the literature about epidemic parameters. Yinon M. Bar-On, Ron Sender, Avi I. Flamholz, Rob Phillips, Ron Milo. A quantitative compendium of COVID-19 epidemiology. arXiv:2006.01283. It is currently a pre-print, so use with care.

2. [Website](https://www.kaggle.com/covid-19-contributions) from US government that contains literature reviews and data extraction for parameters for a number of measures about the natural history of COVID-19. It uses a combination of AI and human intervention to scrape the literature.

## Literature Searches in Progress

| Topic        | Searching & Screening | Quality checking & synthesising |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Asymptomatic | In progress           | In progress                     |
|              |                       |                                 |

## Information about Serology-based tests for COVID-19

This [website](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/COVID-19/serology/Serology-based-tests-for-COVID-19.html#sec3 ) collates type of testing in use by country, including sensitivity and specificity, where available. 

Latent-class [meta-analysis](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-33243/v1 ) estimating sensitivity and specificity for COVID diagnostics DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-33243/v1

## ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey Pilot

This is a [national survey](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147348v1.full.pdf ) (England), collecting throat and nose swabs and accompanying data from individuals in households across England, estimates the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community in England.

## Health Data Sources for Progress of COVID-19 epidemic in UK

Data requirements and sources about the progress of the epidemic in UK (including Scotland). These data are available at different spatial scales and stratified by social factors (eg age, sex, area deprivation, ethnicity). As these are classified as personal data, it may be necessary to obtain special permission to access the data. Permissions will be required for individual level data, finer spatial scales and more stratifications.

Health data are produced separately for Scotland, England and Wales. Public Health England.  

UK Government host a [website](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/ ) containing higher spatial scales and stratifications for all UK Countries. The website contains definitions and meta-data for all countries and variables.

## Data Available at high level spatial scale and no social stratification

## Individual level Hospitalisations, testing and other health data – SCOTLAND

Public Health Scotland (previously ISD) can provide individual level data. These are subject to application and due to strict information governance, need to be accessed via a Safe Haven. Only named people can access the Safe Haven to undertake analysis. The outputs are checked for statistical disclosure control to avoid any identification of individuals. This means we are only likely to produce statistical parameters from the data.

Further information: [here](https://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/eDRIS/COVID-19/ ) and [here](https://www.informationgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/pbpphsc/)

## Summary of variables requested and possible data products

Numbers of hospital admissions, times of admission to hospital, testing (multiple tests incl. previous test negative score if available), entry and exit from ICU and time of discharge or death, treatment & medication by week, age group, deprivation quintile, health board.

## Demographic Data Sources

In general, these data sources can be split into data collected at 2011 Census and therefore available for the whole population of UK at different spatial scales and government surveys which are more up to date but on a sample of the population and therefore fine grained spatial scales are more limited. Population estimates by age, sex and spatial scales are available annually.

| Variable | Data Source | Spatial Scale | Social Scale |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Population counts | NRS – mid-year estimates 2018 <br> ONS – mid-year estimates 2018 | Datazone <br> LSOA, MSOA | 5 year age bands, sex, area deprivation | 
| Household Type counts | Census - 2011 | Output area, Datazone (Scotland) <br> LSOA, MSOA (England) | 5 year age bands, sex, area deprivation |

**Notes:** Most UK surveys will have some detail on households so data products/analysis may be able to produce estimates for different households (*e.g.* travel diaries using the National Travel Survey)
