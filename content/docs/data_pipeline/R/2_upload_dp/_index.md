# How to upload a data product

## Workflow

1. Push metadata associated with your data product to the data registry
   * Choose a submission script (below)
   * Edit the script
   * Push the script to GitHub
   * Check to make sure the version of the script you're about to run is exactly the same as the one you've pushed to GitHub â€“ if it isn't, push all changes now!
   * Run the script

2. Upload your raw data (*e.g.* a csv file) to the Boydorr server
   * Ask Richard Reeve for access to the server
   * Upload your file to the Boydorr server, at this location:<br>
   `/srv/ftp/[namespace]/[data_product_name]/[version_number].csv`

     In terminal (MacOS):

     ``` bash
     scp mylocaldir/[data_product_name]/[version_number].csv myusername@boydorr.gla.ac.uk:/srv/ftp/[namespace]/[data_product_name]/[version_number].csv
     ```

     or at the command prompt (Windows):
     ``` cmd
     scp c:\path\to\local\folder\[data_product_name]\[version_number].csv myusername@boydorr.gla.ac.uk:/srv/ftp/[namespace]/[data_product]/[version_number].csv
     ```

3. Upload your data product
   * If it's an HDF5 file, upload it to the Boydorr server at this location:<br>
   `/srv/ftp/[namespace]/[data_product_name]/[version_number].h5`
   * If it's a TOML file, push it to the [ScottishCovidResponse/DataRepository](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/DataRepository) repository on GitHub, at this location:<br>
   `/[namespace]/[data_product_name]/[version_number].toml`

## Submission script templates

Submission scripts are used to upload metadata to the data registry. A number of submission script templates are available in the SCRCdata package. To access them either clone the [repository](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/SCRCdata) and go to the `inst/templates` directory, or just follow the links on this page.

### Good templates

Use these scripts if you have a single original source (*e.g.* a website or database), a single raw data file (*e.g.* a csv file), a single processing script (to convert the raw data file into an h5/hdf5 file), and a single data product (*e.g.* an h5/hdf5 file).

[upload_everything2][10]
: You have everything mentioned above.

[upload_everything][9]
: You have everything mentioned above. This is an unwrapped version of `upload_everything2` with more scope for tweaking.

[upload_distribution_from_paper][8]
: You have a distribution (raw data) taken from a paper (original source). You can generate the toml file (data product) here so you don't need a processing script.

[upload_multiple_estimates_from_paper][7]
: You have multiple point-estimates (raw data) taken from a paper (original source). You can generate the toml file (data product) here so you don't need a processing script.

[upload_estimate_from_paper][6]
: You have a point-estimate (raw data) taken from a paper (original source). You can generate the toml file (data product) here so you don't need a processing script.

:exclamation: If you have a more complicated situation, *e.g.* [multiple original sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScottishCovidResponse/SCRCdata/master/inst/SCRC/scotgov_dz_lookup.R), please seek guidance.

### Try not to use these templates...

Use these scripts if you don't have an original source or a processing script and want to upload a data product anyway. Bad!

[upload_array][5]
: You have an array converted to an h5 file (data product), but no original source, no raw data, and no processing script.

[upload_table][4]
: You have a table converted to an h5 file (data product), but no original source, no raw data, and no processing script.

[upload_multiple_parameters_in_one_toml][3]
: You have a toml file containing multiple point-estimates and/or distributions (data product), but no original source, no raw data, and no processing script.

[upload_distribution][2]
: You have a distribution (that you made up in your head) and you want to create a toml file (data product). You have no original source, no raw data, and no processing script.

[upload_estimate][1]
: You have a point-estimate (that you made up in your head) and you want to create a toml file (data product). You have no original source, no raw data, and no processing script.
