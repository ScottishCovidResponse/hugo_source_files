# How to upload a data product

1. You need to push metadata associated with your data product to the data registry. To do this, you need to choose a submission script template, edit it, and run it.

2. Now you need to upload your raw data (*e.g.* a csv file) and your data product (*e.g.* an h5/hdf5 or toml file) to the Boydorr Server.
