# Data product name

The location of a data product:

`ftp://boydorr.gla.ac.uk/scrc/records/SARS-CoV-2/scotland/cases-and-management/testing/0.20200923.0.h5`

is given by:

`ftp://boydorr.gla.ac.uk/scrc/[Data Product Name]/[Data Product Version].h5`

Thus, the `Data Product Name` is used to locate the file, as well as describe its contents (since the filename is its version number).
