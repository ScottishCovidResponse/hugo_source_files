# How to name a data product

The name of a data product should be the same as its path.

For example, the location of a data product:

`ftp://boydorr.gla.ac.uk/scrc/records/SARS-CoV-2/scotland/cases-and-management/testing/0.20200923.0.h5`

is given by:

`ftp://boydorr.gla.ac.uk/scrc/[data_product_name]/[version_number].h5`

Thus, the `data_product_name` is used to locate the file, as well as describe its contents (since the filename is its version number).
