## Who are we?
The Scottish COVID-19 Response Consortium is a consortium originally formed by three organisations

- The [Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/boydorr/) at the University of Glasgow
- The Scottish Government's [Centre of Expertise on Animal Disease Outbreaks](https://www.epicscotland.org/) (EPIC)
- [Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland](https://www.bioss.ac.uk/)

Researchers in these organisations jointly responded to a call by the [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/health-and-wellbeing/ramp/) to develop more epidemiological models of COVID-19 spread ([RAPID ASSISTANCE IN MODELLING THE PANDEMIC: RAMP](https://epcced.github.io/ramp/)), in order to develop a more robust and clearer understanding of the impacts of different exit strategies from lockdown. Scientists from several other organisations across the UK and abroad have now joined the consortium to provide additional expertise in specific areas.
