# SCRC docs 

Greetings people of the SCRC. Welcome to our documentation website. I hope you find it useful!

If you want to edit or add to any of the pages here, please click on the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of the page you want to edit. This will take you to a GitHub repository, which stores the source files for that particular page. From there you can click on the tiny pencil (on hover: Edit this file), which will allow you to make any edits you want. Please remember that any tables or fancy formatting will have to be written in markdown / html to be visible. If you need any help with this please [get in touch](mailto:sonia.mitchell@glasgow.ac.uk). Once you're finished, just click the link at the bottom of the page to create a new branch and start a pull request.

If you want to add new pages to the website let me know I'll generate an empty page for you (a tiny line of code needs to be added so that the menu doesn't break). From there you can follow the steps above.

Alternatively, if there's anything you think might be useful but don't have the resource to add it yourself, let me know and I'll put it on the list.
