# SCRC 

## Who are we?
The Scottish COVID-19 Response Consortium is a consortium originally formed by three organisations

- The [Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/boydorr/) at the University of Glasgow
- The Scottish Government's [Centre of Expertise on Animal Disease Outbreaks](https://www.epicscotland.org/) (EPIC)
- [Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland](https://www.bioss.ac.uk/)

Researchers in these organisations jointly responded to a call by the [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/health-and-wellbeing/ramp/) to develop more epidemiological models of COVID-19 spread ([RAPID ASSISTANCE IN MODELLING THE PANDEMIC: RAMP](https://epcced.github.io/ramp/)), in order to develop a more robust and clearer understanding of the impacts of different exit strategies from lockdown. Scientists from several other organisations across the UK and abroad have now joined the consortium to provide additional expertise in specific areas. 

## Our outputs:

During and since the intial three months of RAMP work, our major achievements have been:

- Seven software epidemidogical models in four different programming languages and using multiple scientific approaches. These models have been assesed favourably against a software checklist in internal review.
- Data APIs in five languages (python, Julia, R, Java and C++) that simplify provenance recording, allowing input data to be verified as it is used, and model outputs to be traced back to the model code and input data that were used to produce them.
- A set of curated, traceable source data useful for epidemiological modelling on Covid-19.
- A database to hold metadata and index the data.
- Data processing code in `R` to populate the database.

These are discoverable via our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse).
